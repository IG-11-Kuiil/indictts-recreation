# IndicTTS (Colab)

This Colab has three cells.

1) Cell 1 installs system tools and a Python 3.11 venv with required packages.  
2) Cell 2 downloads `hi.zip`, unpacks, updates FastPitch config to one speaker, and prepares a cleaned checkpoint.  
3) Cell 3 runs Coqui TTS to synthesize a Hindi WAV and plays it.

Test text is inside Cell 3. Edit it if needed.
